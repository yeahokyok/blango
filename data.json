Despite some recent easing in the United States, energy prices – including prices at the pump – are leading the way due to supply chain issues caused by COVID and fallout from Russia’s war with Ukraine.\r\n\r\nWhile the national average for gas is down to $3.78 per gallon as of this writing, it was as high as $4.35 a month ago, even higher a couple months before that! This recent decline in price provided some relief to our wallets, yet the data still shows that we’re well above the $3.15 average national gas price from 12 months ago.\r\n\r\nAs gas prices increase, other commodity prices are driven up since they need to be transported. To combat this, the Fed has instituted aggressive monetary policy by increasing interest rates to increase the cost of borrowing. This rise in rates has added even more uncertainty into the stock market since higher rates tend to eat into the bottom lines of publicly traded companies.\r\n\r\nI’m sharing a 10,000 foot view of the situation, not because I want you to feel hopeless, but so you can DO something about it, powered by data.\r\n\r\nMost forms of investing that are considered very safe – bonds, savings accounts, CD’s, etc. – return very low interest rates. At the very least, most of these vehicles are expected to return less than the overall stock market over long periods of time, without the risk of losing principle.\r\n\r\nEnter Series I Bonds from the US Treasury. These bonds are directly linked to inflation metrics, and there is virtually no risk of loss of principle as they are guaranteed by the US government. Typically these bonds would fit in the category mentioned above; low risk, low reward as US inflation tends to average around 2% year over year. The return on these bonds is indexed every 6 months, and the most recent results have these bonds returning a whopping 9.62% for this period.\r\n\r\nThe number will be re-indexed again in October and while many economists are saying the worst of inflation is behind us, we can expect higher than average inflation numbers for the upcoming October indexing, at the very least. The way these bonds earn interest, regardless of WHEN you buy them (as long as it’s before October 2022) you will earn the 9.62% interest rate for 6 months, and rates will reset for you every 6 months from there. In a worst case scenario (for this investment), let’s say the inflation percentage drops to ZERO in the next readout (it won’t). Holding these bonds for one year would still result in an annualized return of almost 5%, an absolute boon of a return on a guaranteed security.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that you must hold these bonds for at least 1 year, and there are some interest penalties for selling them in less than 5 years. The maximum purchase per year through TreasuryDirect is $10,000 for most taxpayers with additional provisions for reinvesting tax returns. My strategy is to treat these bonds as a 1-5 year savings account in an environment where stocks are more unpredictable than ever and inflation is eroding the money that is sitting in our bank accounts doing nothing.\r\n\r\nI am not a registered investment advisor and encourage everyone to do their own research as everyone’s financial situation is different.
